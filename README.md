# Java Data Mining Package
> A Java library for machine learning and data analytics

The Java Data Mining Package (JDMP) is an open source Java library for data analysis and machine learning. 
It facilitates the access to data sources and machine learning algorithms (e.g. clustering, regression, 
classification, graphical models, optimization) and provides visualization modules. 
JDMP provides a number of algorithms and tools, but also interfaces to other machine learning and data 
mining packages (Weka, LibLinear, Elasticsearch, LibSVM, Mallet, Lucene, Octave).
